NAME
  blinkip - an IP notification daemon for the Raspberry Pi
SYNOPSIS
  blinkip [-d] [-h] [-s]
  service blinkipd [{start [-d][-h][-s]|stop|status|restart [-d][-h][-s]}]
DESCRIPTION
  An IP notification daemon for the Raspberry Pi.

  BlinkIP is an open source Linux daemon for

    - blinking one of the Raspberry Pi's on-board LEDs with the current
      IP address
    - writing the current network config data (including the IP address) to a
      convenient place to read it (e.g. ~/.blink-ip.txt)

  You can find the source code on GitHub:

    https://github.com/hamishcunningham/pi-tronics/tree/master/blinkip

  The core of the daemon is defined in three files:
    - /etc/blinkip.conf - configuration data
    - /usr/sbin/blinkip - the daemon itself
    - /etc/init.d/blinkipd - an interface to the init subsystem that
      Linux uses to manage daemons (amongst other things)

  The last of these, blinkipd, is used by the operating system to start and
  stop BlinkIP at boot or shutdown time, and can be used to control the daemon
  manually when required. For example this command will stop the daemon:

    sudo service blinkip stop

  The LED blink code was derived from Chris Meyers' perl script described here --

  (thanks Chris!).
