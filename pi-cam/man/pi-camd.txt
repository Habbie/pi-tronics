NAME
  pi-cam - a simple camera daemon for the Raspberry Pi
SYNOPSIS
  pi-cam [-d] [-h] [-c] [-s]
  service pi-camd [{start [-d][-h][-s]|stop|status|restart [-d][-h][-s]}]
DESCRIPTION
  Battery monitoring for the Raspberry Pi...

  Pi-Cam is an open source Linux daemon for switch-based picture taking on the
  Pi's camera module.

  You can find the source code on GitHub:

    https://github.com/hamishcunningham/pi-tronics/tree/master/pi-cam

  The core of the daemon is defined in three files:
    - /etc/pi-cam.conf - configuration data
    - /usr/sbin/pi-cam - the daemon itself
    - /etc/init.d/pi-camd - an interface to the init subsystem that
      Linux uses to manage daemons (amongst other things)

  The last of these, pi-camd, is used by the operating system to start and
  stop Pi-Cam at boot or shutdown time, and can be used to control the daemon
  manually when required. For example this command will stop the daemon:

    sudo service pi-cam stop
