NAME
  pibrush - The PiBrush interactive art and technology exhibit
SYNOPSIS
  pibrush [-s(erver)] [-c(lient)]
  service pibrushd [{start [-d][-h][-s]|stop|status|restart [-d][-h][-s]}]
DESCRIPTION
  Art for the Raspberry Pi...

  PiBrush is a set of client and server software for the PiBrush exhibit,
  previously shown at the Sheffield Ideas Bazaar 2013. It is an attempt to
  simulate flinging a paintbrush full of paint at a canvas. More inforrmation
  is available on the website:

    http://pi.gate.ac.uk/pages/pibrush.html

  You can also find the source code on GitHub:

    https://github.com/hamishcunningham/pi-tronics/tree/master/pibrush

  The PiBrush software is broken down into two portions. Files dealing with
  installing and running the software nicely, and then the actually control
  software to play with. The latter can be completely ignored if all that's
  goig on is an exhibit.

  Files deaing with running PiBrush as a service:
    - /etc/default/pibrushd - configuration data
    - /etc/init.d/pibrushd - init script that can launch /usr/bin/pibrush
      on boot, can also be used to stop PiBrush, e.g. sudo service pibrush stop
    - /usr/bin/pibrush - wrapper script to start PiBrush, reads in the
      configuration data

  Control software:
    - /opt/pibrush/accel_client.py - the client software for reading the
      accelerometer and transferring that data over the network
    - /opt/pibrush/accel_server.py - the server software that reads the
      network data and translates it to paint drops on the screen

  If running the client, it will be necessary to seperately setup the XLoBorg:

    sudo bash
    cd /opt/pibrush
    unzip examples.zip
    chmod +x install
    ./install.sh
    reboot
OPTIONS
  -s    Server mode, for the Pi connected to the display
  -c    Client mode, for the Pi with the XLoBorg accelerometer

BUGS
  Almost certainly, but we try to do our best...
