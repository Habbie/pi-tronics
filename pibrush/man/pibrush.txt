NAME
  pibrush - a simple camera daemon for the Raspberry Pi
  TODO
SYNOPSIS
  pibrush [-d] [-h] [-c] [-s]
  service pibrushd [{start [-d][-h][-s]|stop|status|restart [-d][-h][-s]}]
DESCRIPTION
  Battery monitoring for the Raspberry Pi...

  Pi-Cam is an open source Linux daemon for switch-based picture taking on the
  Pi's camera module.

  You can find the source code on GitHub:

    https://github.com/hamishcunningham/pi-tronics/tree/master/pibrush

  The core of the daemon is defined in three files:
    - /etc/pibrush.conf - configuration data
    - /usr/sbin/pibrush - the daemon itself
    - /etc/init.d/pibrushd - an interface to the init subsystem that
      Linux uses to manage daemons (amongst other things)

  The last of these, pibrushd, is used by the operating system to start and
  stop Pi-Cam at boot or shutdown time, and can be used to control the daemon
  manually when required. For example this command will stop the daemon:

    sudo service pibrush stop

OPTIONS
  -d          Turn on debug mode.
  -h          The option -h displays help.
  -c          Command-line mode: for running the pibrush script standalone.
  -s          Simulation mode: for testing etc. on non-Pi systems.
EXAMPLE
  Restart the daemon with debugging on:

    $ sudo service pibrushd restart -d
