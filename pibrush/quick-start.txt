PiBrush QuickStart Guide
========================

-----------------
For the Impatient
-----------------

Plug the Pi with the switch on into a monitor and boot it. Put the batteries
into the other Pi and boot it. Wave it around! Paint should splash on the
screen...

To clear the screen press the red button on the server. To shutdown the server
press the same button for longer. To shutdown the battery-powered Pi, press
the button through the hole in its lid.

Have fun!

What is PiBrush?
----------------
PiBrush is an interactive RaspberryPi based art exhibit around the idea of
using an XLoBorg accelerometer to create Jackson Pollock type digital
paintings. And now that you've just received a PiBrush kit, what do you do?

-----------------------
Setting up the Hardware
-----------------------
PiBrush consists of two RaspberryPis. A Model B "server" unit, and a Model A
"client" unit. The server is to be plugged into a 1080p HDMI monitor. Ensure
that both the server and client are equipped with USB Wi-fi modules. The client
also employs our prototype MoPi mobile power board for battery power. It uses
8 AA NiMH rechargeable batteries, so it doesn't need a cord. The server unit
however will need the standard 5V micro-USB power supply.

-----------
Powering up
-----------
Powering up the server is as simple as connecting the power. The client is
powered on by first connecting the red jumper lead from the battery pack if it
is not already. If it's just been plugged in it will power on automatically. If
it doesn't, press and hold down the power button on the top of the client.

----------
Having fun
----------
Like the Nintendo Wii, we've made having fun as easy as possible. Grab the
client and proceed to wave your virtual paintbrush, or PiBrush as we like to
call it, around. You may need to wait a few seconds for everything to finish
booting. A new painting? Press the red button on top of the server until the
screen clears. The old painting is automatically saved.

-------------
Shutting down
-------------
On the client, press and hold the power button until the light flashes red.
This indicates that the halt command has been issued and that the system is
powering down. A soft switch will trigger when the client is fully off and the
lights will go out. On the server, press and hold the red button for 10
seconds. At this point the screen will be saved and the system will execute a
clean shutdown. You'll know it's working because the console will return.

============================================
Troubleshooting & Frequently Asked Questions
============================================

---------------------------------------------------
Am I supposed to be seeing a console on the server?
---------------------------------------------------
Ah, no. It should be a white screen. Try checking that the monitor is full
1080p.

--------------------------------------
Why isn't the client isn't turning on?
--------------------------------------
Check that the lead from the battery pack is fully connected, and that the
batteries are charged. They need to register more than 8V all together to
power on the client. If it's connected and charged up, try disconnecting, the
batteries. Let it sit for a few moments, and try again.

------------------------------------
I'm waving, but nothing's happening!
------------------------------------
It's probably the Wi-fi acting up. Because that never happens under Linux. What
PiBrush does by default is create an ad-hoc Wi-fi network called 'pibrush'
between the client and server using the addresses 192.168.31.2 and 192.168.31.1
respectively. Ad-hoc mode is used to ensure operation anywhere, but if you've
got a dedicated wireless network and you're not going anywhere, PiBrush will
happily use it to. Simply add the network to the wpa_supplicant.conf file.

--------------------------
What's up with the colors?
--------------------------
If you're referring to the apparently random paint colors, that's exactly what
they are. Random. Enjoy!

---------------
I zig, it zags?
---------------
Occasionally you may experience times when flicking the paintbrush (the
client) one direction results in paint splattering in a completely different
one. This is a minor bug that results from the method used to go from
acceleration to displacement on the screen. For the moment we consider this a
limitation of the hardware. It's all open so you can have a go at fixing it!
(If you do, let us know!) In the meantime, it's not really a bug. It's a
feature. (Try a slightly gentler touch and see what happens...)

-----------------------------
Where are my paintings saved?
-----------------------------
In the /home/pi directory of the server's SD card.
