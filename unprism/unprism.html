<h1 class="cow-title-heading">unPrism: Simple Secure Comms at Home</h1>

<p>As <a class="cow-url" href="https://leap.se/">the LEAP project</a> says, democracy of all shapes and
sizes is meaningless without <b>the right to whisper</b>. All democracies currently
comprise groups of widely divergent levels of resource and power (think Rupert
Murdoch or Bill Gates vs. a homeless person, or a million other less extreme
examples). It is impossible, in these circumstances, to remove the ability of
the powerful to coerce the powerless. As a consequence, if the powerful have
universal access to communication, democracy is broken.</p>

<p>Now consider Edward Snowden's
<a class="cow-url" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/the-nsa-files">revelations about Prism</a>,
Tempora and related programmes. It turns our that all your email is
<a class="cow-url" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/31/nsa-top-secret-program-online-data">bcc'd to <tt>BoredYoungSpies@nsa.gov</tt></a>, and that you're a Facebook friend of
<tt>NoSenseOfHumour@gchq.gov.uk</tt> The NSA (in partnership with the UK's GCHQ),
<a class="cow-url" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/31/nsa-top-secret-program-online-data">collects 'nearly everything a user does on the internet'</a>. Not only do the
powerful have unfettered access to our communications, but so do
<a class="cow-url" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/03/edward-snowden-files-john-lanchester">hundreds of thousands of contractors</a> (and anyone who hacks or bribes their
way into <em>their</em> systems)<span class="cow-footnote" name="footnote1"><sup><a href="#footnote1">1</a></sup></span>. And it seems pretty certain that
whatever dirty business the US (and UK) are wrapped up in is also going on in
China and a bunch of other countries.</p>

<p>One of the worst consequences of the spies' actions is that the companies who
have the resources and motivation to protect their customers' privacy (the bit
software and internet companies &mdash; Google, Microsoft, Apple, Facebook, etc.)
have been completely compromised. The US spy agencies have forced them to
allow access to our data without making their compliance public. They also do
this to smaller companies, as
<a class="cow-url" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/22/lavabit-founder-us-surveillance-snowden">Lavabit case</a> demonstrates. Every US provider is now an insecure place to
store data by definition (and stand to
<a class="cow-url" href="http://www.idgconnect.com/blog-abstract/3720/european-datacentre-options-appeal-post-nsa-world">lose around $10 billion</a> yearly as a result).</p>

<p>What to do?</p>

<p>There are two quite different problems that we might address:</p>

<ol>
<li>how to prevent powerful agencies like the NSA from compromising our privacy
  under any circumstances</li>
<li>how to protect most of our data most of the time</li>
</ol>

<p>These two problems are very different in lots of ways. The brave souls who
stand up for human rights in oppressive regimes need the highest levels of
privacy and security (i.e. 1.), of course. But many people are not in such
difficult circumstances &mdash; in which case the much smaller and more tractable
goal of reasonably secure privacy (2.) is what we need.</p>

<p>The situation is very similar to the level of security I want for my wallet &mdash;
I'm not about to wrap it in inch-thick chains and keep it in a fire-proof safe
in the basement, but I'm also not going to leave it lying around on the cafe
table when I go to the toilet!</p>

<p>I also don't expect the police to knock on my door with a search warrant &mdash;
the chances of them mistaking me for Osama Bin Laden are relatively low (even
if I do look a bit of a zombie on Monday mornings). So I'm not looking for the
level of security that will hide me from a full-scale criminal investigation.
(This is not to say that I'm unaware of miscarriages of justice or worried
about increases in police powers; just that the likelihood of this is low
enough that I don't see any need to take special steps.)</p>

<p>This project is about the digital version of that level of security: secure
and private communication that is state-of-the-art, but which is not intended
to protect the crown jewels or stand up to an aggressive investigation by a
well-funded agency. This level of security <b>is</b> intended to defeat Prism and
the like &mdash; hence <b>unPrism</b>. Read on!</p>
