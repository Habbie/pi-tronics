<h1 class="cow-title-heading">unPrism: Simple Secure Comms at Home</h1>

<p>As <a class="cow-url" href="https://leap.se/">the LEAP project</a> says, democracy of all shapes and
sizes is meaningless without <b>the right to whisper</b>. All democracies currently
comprise groups of widely divergent levels of resource and power (think Rupert
Murdoch or Bill Gates vs. a homeless person, or a million other less extreme
examples). It is impossible, in these circumstances, to remove the ability of
the powerful to coerce the powerless. As a consequence, if the powerful have
universal access to communication, democracy is broken.</p>

<p>Now consider Edward Snowden's
<a class="cow-url" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/the-nsa-files">revelations about Prism</a>,
Tempora and related programmes. It turns our that all your email is
<a class="cow-url" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/31/nsa-top-secret-program-online-data">bcc'd to <tt>BoredYoungSpies@nsa.gov</tt></a>, and that you're a Facebook friend of
<tt>NoSenseOfHumour@gchq.gov.uk</tt> The NSA (in partnership with the UK's GCHQ),
<a class="cow-url" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/31/nsa-top-secret-program-online-data">collects 'nearly everything a user does on the internet'</a>. Not only do the
powerful have unfettered access to our communications, but so do tens of
thousands of contractors (and anyone who hacks or bribes their way into
<em>their</em> systems). And it seems pretty certain that whatever dirty business the
US (and UK) are wrapped up in is also going on in China and a bunch of other
countries.</p>

<p>One of the worst consequences of the spies' actions is that the companies who
have the resources and motivation to protect their customers' privacy (the bit
software and internet companies &mdash; Google, Microsoft, Apple, Facebook, etc.)
have been completely compromised. The US spy agencies have forced them to
allow access to our data without making their compliance public. They also do
this to smaller companies, as
<a class="cow-url" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/22/lavabit-founder-us-surveillance-snowden">Lavabit case</a> demonstrates. Every US provider is now an insecure place to
store data by definition (and stand to
<a class="cow-url" href="http://www.idgconnect.com/blog-abstract/3720/european-datacentre-options-appeal-post-nsa-world">lose around $10 billion</a> yearly as a result).</p>

<p>What to do?</p>

<p>There are two quite different problems that we might address:</p>

<ol>
<li>how to prevent powerful agencies like the NSA from compromising our privacy
  under any circumstances</li>
<li>how to protect most of our data most of the time</li>
</ol>

<p>These two problems are very different in lots of ways. The brave souls who
stand up for human rights in oppressive regimes need 1., of course. But
luckily many people are not in such difficult circumstances &mdash; in which case
the must smaller and more tractable problem of 2. (reasonablely secure privacy
much of the time) is what we need.</p>
