Unused:</p>

<p>I also don't expect the police to knock on my door with a search warrant &mdash;
the chances of them mistaking me for Osama Bin Laden are relatively low (even
if I do look a bit of a zombie on Monday mornings). So I'm not looking for the
level of security that will hide me from a full-scale criminal investigation.
(This is not to say that I'm unaware of miscarriages of justice or worried
about increases in police powers; just that the likelihood of this is low
enough that I don't see any need to take special steps.)</p>

<p>This project is about the digital version of that level of security: secure
and private communication that is state-of-the-art, but which is not intended
to protect the crown jewels or stand up to an aggressive investigation by a
well-funded agency. This level of security <b>is</b> intended to defeat Prism and
the like &mdash; hence <b>unPrism</b>. Read on!</p>
