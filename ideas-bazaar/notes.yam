1. rewire the screen for 5v                     [DONE]
2. control circuit, switches                    [DONE]
3. box                                          [DONE]
4. camera UI                                    
   - add netthing wifi
   - need to install and run as daemon
   - faster convert code
   - clear the terminal -- e.g. "clear >/dev/pts/1" (get term by "tty")
     - sudo bash -c "clear >/dev/tty1"
   - debug the process ids stuff

Future-Making -- an exploration of engineered art and social science with
open-source hard/soft-ware.

This will be a rolling event over two days with around a dozen exhibits plus
an hourly short stage show. The target audience is anyone curious, with
secondary schools invited to attend if the timing of the event permits.  The
performers are expected to be engineers, musicians, social scientists,
dancers, hackers and visual artists.

There is a new conjunction emerging around open hardware, maker culture, and
art. Parallels exist with the explosive change in pop culture pressaged by
punk in the late 1970s: from the Homebrew Computer Club trading circuits and
information and Iain M. Banks' legacy of utopian technofutures, blending
electro-augmented humanity with benevolent AI; from the wearable electronics
kits (eg from Adafruit.com - echoing Lady Ada Lovelace, inventor of the
computer algorithm) to the latest rounds of sampling and remix.

Open-source hardware (eg
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_open-source_hardware_projects) allows
people to make their own robots, cameras, electrocardiagraph machines and even
full computers by downloading schematics and building â€“ incorporating any
changes they envisage - and, typically, free open-source software is available
to run these projects.  3D printers have helped this adoption of the
open-everything ethos.

There also exists a stack of DIY projects based on the new schools computing
board - the Raspberry Pi (egs
http://www.raspberrypi.org/phpBB3/viewforum.php?f=15 and
http://www.raspberrypi.org/archives/tag/music )

The cases of Edward Snowden and Chelsea Manning, however, attest readily to
questions around ownership of data and 'patent-trolling' is slowing down the
adoption of cheaper industrial processes --  we will engage in an
age-appropriate exploration of this topic  in the context of the international
'broadcast' nature of the internet.

- Ideas Bazaar, Festival of the Mind
  - The Raspberry Pi as a meeting point for DIY electronics, open
    computing and music tech, partly as a means of outreach to schools and
    potential undergrads.
  - The Raspberry Pi -- http://www.sheffield.ac.uk/ideasbazaar -- is a
    small cheap computer which is very easy to cobble together with other
    devices. It has a large community behind it and is one of the drivers
    behind proposed changes in the schools ICT curriculum. As part of a
    trend to open hardware and maker culture the Pi is also a vehicle for
    localist responses to climate change and peak oil: the more we
    manufacture locally the more secure we are (the Pi is made in Wales);
    the less energy we use the less carbon we pump into the atmosphere
    (the Pi is a low power device).
  - The exhibit will try to give a taster of these broad areas, and
    motivate our proposal for a larger affair for The Festival of the Mind
    and beyond.

Future Maker -- an exploration of engineered art with the
Raspberry Pi

This will be a rolling event with 6 or 10 exhibits plus an
hourly short stage show. The target audience is the young and
the young at heart. The performers will be musicians,
engineers, hackers and artists.

There is a new conjunction emerging around open hardware,
maker culture, art and music. There are parallels with the
explosive change in pop culture pressaged punk in the late
1970s: from Iain M. Banks' legacy of utopian technofutures
blending electro-augmented humanity with benevolent AI, to the
wearable electronics kits from Adafruit.com (echoing Lady Ada
Lovelace, inventor of the computer bug); from the latest
rounds of sampling and remix to a stack of projects based on
the new schools computing board the Raspberry Pi --
http://www.raspberrypi.org/archives/tag/music -- my personal
favourite being the use of capacitive sensing wired up to a
bunch of root vegetables as an instrument -- there would be no
problem selling the novelty of this invention, even to a jaded
REF panel!

Other stuff we discussed:

- tweeting and texting with the Pi
- from analogue to digital...

TODOs from Bo
- performers from Sheffield's arts-minded, hacker-oriented, community
- Sheffield was well-known for electro-pop in the early 80s) details will
  change, eg was talking to a ballerina last night about the possibility of
  projecting choreographic notation (featuring a flowchart with highlighted
  subroutines, etc) and having her dance the piece that emerges (somehow?)
  from an RPi for ten minutes every hour
- the Brick Pi notion would involve, as I see it, building a sculpture that
  moved according to analogue user inputs


Misc 
- Nick currently uses a laptop to loop audio (despite the hardware list on his
  web pages) but has explored the use of a reprogrammable set of pedals via
  arduino and might be interested.
  http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=5yv1yya9T78 for an
  example of Nick's work with Meson on the Tarana100 project a few years ago.
- Mark (very busy most of the year as a sound engineer) is very much into
  analogue/digital sound making (generally uses supercollider -
  http://supercollider.sourceforge.net/ ) but might be interestable - I'm
  happy to contact him.
- The people I know actively VJing at present use Macs (I experimented with
  LiVeS a while back but reverted to using prepared vids for backdrops) but
  something like http://ftp.dyne.org/freej/ might be used with a small RPi
  cluster - possibly (linked to supercollider as a trigger) a small CompSci
  student project?
- BrickPi might be worth watching -
