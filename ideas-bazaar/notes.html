Ideas Bazaar, Festival of the Mind
[original proposal]</p>

<ul>
<li>The Raspberry Pi as a meeting point for DIY electronics, open computing and
  music tech, partly as a means of outreach to schools and potential
  undergrads.</li>
<li>The Raspberry Pi is a small cheap computer which is very easy to cobble
  together with other devices. It has a large community behind it and is one
  of the drivers behind proposed changes in the schools ICT curriculum.</li>
<li>As part of a trend to open hardware and maker culture the Pi is also a
  vehicle for localist responses to climate change and peak oil: the more we
  manufacture locally the more secure we are (the Pi is made in Wales); the
  less energy we use the less carbon we pump into the atmosphere (the Pi is a
  low power device).</li>
<li>This exhibit tries to give a taster of these broad areas, and motivate our
  proposal for a larger affair for The Festival of the Mind and beyond.</li>
</ul>

Future Maker &mdash; an exploration of engineered art with the Raspberry Pi
[original blurb]</p>

<p>This will be a rolling event with 6 or 10 exhibits plus an hourly short stage
show. The target audience is the young and the young at heart. The performers
will be musicians, engineers, hackers and artists.</p>

<p>There is a new conjunction emerging around open hardware, maker culture, art
and music. There are parallels with the explosive change in pop culture
pressaged punk in the late 1970s: from Iain M. Banks' legacy of utopian
technofutures blending electro-augmented humanity with benevolent AI, to the
wearable electronics kits from Adafruit.com (echoing Lady Ada Lovelace,
inventor of the computer bug); from the latest rounds of sampling and remix to
a stack of projects based on the new schools computing board the Raspberry Pi
&mdash; <a class="cow-url" href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/archives/tag/music">http://www.raspberrypi.org/archives/tag/music</a> &mdash; my personal favourite
being the use of capacitive sensing wired up to a bunch of root vegetables as
an instrument &mdash; there would be no problem selling the novelty of this
invention, even to a jaded REF panel!</p>

Other stuff we discussed:</p>
<ul>
<li>tweeting and texting with the Pi</li>
<li>from analogue to digital...</li>
</ul>

TODOs from Bo</p>
<ul>
<li>performers from Sheffield's arts-minded, hacker-oriented, community</li>
<li>Sheffield was well-known for electro-pop in the early 80s) details will
  change, e.g. was talking to a ballerina last night about the possibility of
  projecting choreographic notation (featuring a flowchart with highlighted
  subroutines, etc) and having her dance the piece that emerges (somehow?)
  from an RPi for ten minutes every hour</li>
<li>the Brick Pi notion would involve, as I see it, building a sculpture that
  moved according to analogue user inputs</li>
</ul>

<p><hr>
Misc </p>
<ul>
<li>Nick currently uses a laptop to loop audio (despite the hardware list on his
  web pages) but has explored the use of a reprogrammable set of pedals via
  arduino and might be interested.
  <a class="cow-url" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=5yv1yya9T78">http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=5yv1yya9T78</a> for an
  example of Nick's work with Meson on the Tarana100 project a few years ago.</li>
<li>Mark (very busy most of the year as a sound engineer) is very much into
  analogue/digital sound making (generally uses supercollider &mdash;
  <a class="cow-url" href="http://supercollider.sourceforge.net/">http://supercollider.sourceforge.net/</a> ) but might be interestable &mdash; I'm
  happy to contact him.</li>
<li>The people I know actively VJing at present use Macs (I experimented with
  LiVeS a while back but reverted to using prepared vids for backdrops) but
  something like <a class="cow-url" href="http://ftp.dyne.org/freej/">http://ftp.dyne.org/freej/</a> might be used with a small RPi
  cluster &mdash; possibly (linked to supercollider as a trigger) a small CompSci
  student project?</li>
<li>BrickPi might be worth watching &mdash;
