NAME
  simbamon - a Simple Battery Monitor daemon
SYNOPSIS
  simbamon [-d] [-h] [-s]
  service simbamond [{start [-d][-h][-s]|stop|status|restart [-d][-h][-s]}]
DESCRIPTION
  Battery monitoring for the Raspberry Pi...

  SimBaMon is an open source Linux daemon for

    - monitoring battery levels
    - sending warning messages to the user if the battery is low
    - shutting down cleanly at critical battery levels
    - managing a power supply on/off switch
    - writing relevant data to the system logs

  You can find the source code on GitHub:

    https://github.com/hamishcunningham/pi-tronics/tree/master/simbamon

  The core of the daemon is defined in three files:
    - /etc/simbamon.conf - configuration data
    - /usr/sbin/simbamon - the daemon itself
    - /etc/init.d/simbamond - an interface to the init subsystem that
      Linux uses to manage daemons (amongst other things)

  The last of these, simbamond, is used by the operating system to start and
  stop SimBaMon at boot or shutdown time, and can be used to control the daemon
  manually when required. For example this command will stop the daemon:

    sudo service simbamon stop

OPTIONS
  -d          Turn on debug mode.
  -h          The option -h displays help.
EXAMPLE
  Restart the daemon with debugging on:

    $ sudo service simbamond restart -d
