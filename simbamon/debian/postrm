# warn users we turned on I2C

*NOTE* (from simbamond postrm script):

When simbamond was installed we turned on the I2C kernel module (if it wasn't
on already). Now that you're uninstalling simbamon, you may wish to turn off
the module if it is not in use by another program. To do that, uncomment the
"blacklist i2c-bcm2708" line in /etc/modprobe.d/raspi-blacklist.conf (by
removing the leading "#"), and remove the "i2c-dev" and "i2c-bcm2708" lines in
/etc/modules.

(If this doesn't mean anything to you, don't worry; you won't break anything
by doing nothing!)
