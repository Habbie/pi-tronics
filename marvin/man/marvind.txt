NAME
  marvin - paranoia for normal people
SYNOPSIS
  marvin [-d] [-h] [-s]
  service marvind [{start [-d][-h][-s]|stop|status|restart [-d][-h][-s]}]
DESCRIPTION
  The Marvelous Marvin!

  You can find the source code on GitHub:

    https://github.com/hamishcunningham/pi-tronics/tree/master/marvin

  The core of the daemon is defined in three files:
    - /etc/default/marvind - configuration data
    - /usr/sbin/marvin - the daemon itself
    - /etc/init.d/marvind - an interface to the init subsystem that
      Linux uses to manage daemons (amongst other things)

  The last of these, marvind, is used by the operating system to start and
  stop marvin at boot or shutdown time, and can be used to control the daemon
  manually when required. For example this command will stop the daemon:

    sudo service marvin stop

OPTIONS
  -d          Turn on debug mode.
  -h          The option -h displays help.
EXAMPLE
  Restart the daemon with debugging on:

    $ sudo service marvind restart -d
